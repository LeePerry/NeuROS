This framework makes it trivial to define, implement and execute containerised Python ROS2 
nodes inside Docker. Images are also provided for several industry standard tools, such as 
Gazebo and NEST.

A relevant literature review, detailed design rationale, and performance comparison against 
competing frameworks can also be found in the included pdf:

   NeuROS - A Distributed Integration Framework for Heterogeneous Neurorobotics Systems.pdf

To build and install NeuROS and it's dependencies, simply run:

   ./install.py

You can optionally specify -y to automatically confirm any prompts.
